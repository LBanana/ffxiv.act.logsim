# ffxiv.act.logsim
This is a stand-alone app to read an act log file and outputs a new live log file (can be used to test applbot).

## Installation
1. Download and unblock (if neccesary) .zip file from releases section (https://github.com/applepudding/ffxiv.act.logsim/releases).
2. Extract .zip to preferably ACT Folder (logsim folder inside ACT main folder)

## Usage

(warning) Remember to clear up the sim file text box in applbot after use (so it will grab proper act log instead of simulation log).

## On Progress
- Integrate the app to applbot plugin (atm it's overly complicated to use)
